# threadsemaphore
This is a program utilizing threads and semaphores in C. The program will first prompt the user if they wish to continue. Next it will attempt to fork a child process, if it is successful then the child process will do all the work. This child process open the file PTAB.txt or create if it does not exist and print the child processes PID. Then this child process will create 4 separate threads that will each print their thread number 10 times to the file. The semaphore will fix the writer problem so only 1 thread can write to the file at a time. (Regardless of order) Once the child process completes, the parent process will output a message and the program closes.
